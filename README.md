# ECE5470_TDandR
Very very simple text detection and recognition 

April 19, 2019

Use detect light text for testing

it works for light and dark, may need mods for dark tho

other buttons are irrelevant atm

we'll figure it out tomorrow/this weekend

### Todo:
- ~~Improve text segmentation~~
- Improve ROI detection/decision
- ~~Add trained model and prediction file ~~
- ~~Add translator API~~
- Finish up the GUI once everythings working

##### Thicken letters, don't detect non-alphanumeric characters
